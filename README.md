**Project Overview**

This project analyzes **Elite Bank’s employee demographics and salary structure** using quantitative methods to support fair and effective HR decisions. It explores how demographic and compensation insights can guide better **recruitment**, **promotion**, and **workforce planning**.
Organizations depend on accurate HR data to ensure fairness and equity in staffing decisions. This project provides a structured analysis of employee attributes such as:

* Age distribution
* Gender representation
* Job roles
* Salary levels
* Department structure

By combining Python based data analysis with structured reporting, this project aims to uncover trends and insights that HR managers can use to improve decision making.

**Data Sources**

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "elitebank_db.csv"which contains employee demographic and salary information extracted from Elite Bank’s internal HR system.

**Objectives**

* Identify patterns in employee demographics
* Examine how salary varies across departments and job positions
* Provide insights for improving fairness in recruitment and promotion
* Support data-driven workforce planning
* Present results in clear visual and statistical formats


 **Tools & Technologies**
* **Aiven PostgreSQL** for cloud-based data storage and extraction
* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
* **SciPy and Statsmodels** for conducting inferential statistical tests such as T-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-square analyses.
* **Jupyter Notebook or Python script**
* **PDF Report** summarizing findings
* **GitHub Repository** for project tracking

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
In the initial data preparation phase, the following tasks were performed:

1. Which department pays the highest average salary?
2. What’s the age distribution of employees?
3. Are widowed employees more common in certain departments?
4. Does higher education translate to higher pay?
5. Which state contributes the most employees?
6. Do male and female employees earn significantly different salaries?
7. Is there a significant difference in average salary across departments?
8. Is there a relationship between marital status and department allocation?


 **Key Insights**

* Distribution of employees across age and gender
* Salary comparisons across job roles
* Department level demographic patterns
* Correlation between employee attributes and compensation


**Recommendations**
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:
- More employees should be hired from regions that are currently underrepresented.
- Development of leadership and mentorship programs to prepare young staff for future roles.
- Salaries in lower paid departments should be reviewed regularly to keep employees motivated. 
- The bank should create strong retention strategies, especially for important departments like IT, HR, and Marketing.
